    <h1>SignalHound Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 19, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>SignalHound is committed to protecting your privacy. This app is designed with privacy as a core principle - we do not collect, store, or share any personal data beyond what is required for the app to function.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>SignalHound does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers or any third parties. All data remains on your device and in your private iCloud storage.</p>

    <h2>Information Stored Locally and in iCloud</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Saved Bluetooth Devices:</strong> The identifiers (UUID) and custom names you assign to your Bluetooth devices are stored locally on your device and synchronized to your private iCloud storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Discovery Cache:</strong> Information about Bluetooth services and characteristics discovered from your devices is cached locally and in your private iCloud to improve app performance.</li>
        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your app settings and preferences are stored locally using UserDefaults.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information stored by SignalHound is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Help you locate your Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices</li>
        <li>Synchronize your saved devices across your iOS devices via iCloud</li>
        <li>Display signal strength and detailed device information</li>
        <li>Provide audio and haptic feedback during device search</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, rent, or transmit your data to any third parties. SignalHound does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Bluetooth Permissions</h2>
    <p>SignalHound requires Bluetooth access to scan for and connect to nearby BLE devices. This permission is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Discover nearby Bluetooth devices</li>
        <li>Measure signal strength (RSSI) to help you locate devices</li>
        <li>Read device information services (battery level, device name, manufacturer, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bluetooth scanning data is never transmitted outside your device.</p>

    <h2>iCloud Storage</h2>
    <p>If you enable iCloud sync, your saved devices and discovery cache are stored in your private iCloud container (<code>iCloud.com.rofoz.SignalHound</code>). This data is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encrypted by Apple using industry-standard encryption</li>
        <li>Stored in your personal iCloud storage quota</li>
        <li>Accessible only to you and your authorized devices</li>
        <li>Never accessible to SignalHound developers or any third parties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can disable iCloud sync at any time in your device Settings, though this will prevent device synchronization across your devices.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data stored by SignalHound is protected by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>iOS system-level encryption when stored locally</li>
        <li>Apple's iCloud encryption when synchronized to the cloud</li>
        <li>iOS app sandboxing - data is isolated from other apps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your data is retained:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Locally:</strong> Until you delete the app or manually delete saved devices</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud:</strong> Until you delete devices within the app or disable iCloud sync</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Deleting the app will remove all local data. iCloud data will remain until manually deleted through the app on another device.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SignalHound does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. The app does not require any account creation or personal information. The app is rated 4+ and is safe for all ages.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is accessible within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete individual devices or all data within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> Device data is stored in standard formats in your iCloud</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
